Lesson: Our First Containers Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will have:

¥	Seen Docker in action.

¥	Started your first containers. 


Docker architecture

Docker is a client-server application.

¥	The Docker Engine (or "daemon")
Receives and processes incoming Docker API requests.

¥	The Docker client
Talks to the Docker daemon via the Docker API.
We'll use mostly the CLI embedded within the docker binary.

¥	Docker Hub Registry
Collection of public images.
The Docker daemon talks to it via the registry API.



Hello World

In your Docker environment, just run the following command:

$ docker run busybox echo hello world 
hello world



That was our first container!

¥	We used one of the smallest, simplest images available: busybox.

¥	busybox is typically used in embedded systems (phones, routers...)

¥	We ran a single process and echo'ed hello world.
