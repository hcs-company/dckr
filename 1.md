Lesson: Our First Containers

Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will have:

-   Seen Docker in action.

-   Started your first containers.

<span id="page77" class="anchor"></span>

Docker architecture

Docker is a client-server application.

-   **The Docker Engine (or "daemon")**

> Receives and processes incoming Docker API requests.

-   **The Docker client**

> Talks to the Docker daemon via the Docker API.
>
> We'll use mostly the CLI embedded within the docker binary.

-   **Docker Hub Registry**

> Collection of public images.
>
> The Docker daemon talks to it via the registry API.

Hello World

In your Docker environment, just run the following command:

$ docker run busybox echo hello world

hello world

That was our first container!

-   We used one of the smallest, simplest images available: busybox.

-   busybox is typically used in embedded systems (phones, routers...)

-   We ran a single process and echo'ed hello world.

A more useful container

Let's run a more exciting container:

$ docker run -it ubuntu root@04c0bb0a6c07:/\#

-   This is a brand new container.

-   It runs a bare-bones, no-frills ubuntu system.

> • -it is shorthand for -i -t.

-   -i tells Docker to connect us to the container's stdin.

-   -t tells Docker that we want a pseudo-terminal.

<span id="page81" class="anchor"></span>

Do something in our container

Try to run figlet in our container.

root@04c0bb0a6c07:/\# figlet hello bash: figlet: command not found

Alright, we need to install it.

<span id="page82" class="anchor"></span>

An obvservation

Let's check how many packages are installed here.

root@04c0bb0a6c07:/

\# dpkg -l | wc -l 189

> • dpkg -l lists the packages installed in our container

-   wc -l counts them

-   If you have a Debian or Ubuntu machine, you can run the same command
    > and compare the results.

<span id="page83" class="anchor"></span>Install a package in our
container

We want figlet, so let's install it:

root@04c0bb0a6c07:/\# apt-get update

...

Fetched 1514 kB in 14s (103 kB/s) Reading package lists... Done

root@04c0bb0a6c07:/\# apt-get install figlet Reading package lists...
Done

...

One minute later, figlet is installed!

| \#  | figlet hello   |           |          |
|-----|----------------|-----------|----------|
| |   | \_             | \_ \_     |          |
|     | |\_\_          | \_\_\_| | | | \_\_\_ |

> | '\_ \\ / \_ \\ | |/ \_ \\
>
> | | | | \_\_/ | | (\_) | |\_| |\_|\\\_\_\_|\_|\_|\\\_\_\_/

<span id="page84" class="anchor"></span>

Exiting our container

Just exit the shell, like you would usually do.

(E.g. with ^D or exit)

> root@04c0bb0a6c07:/\# exit

-   Our container is now in a *stopped* state.

-   It still exists on disk, but all compute resources have been
    > freed up.

<span id="page85" class="anchor"></span>Starting another container

What if we start a new container, and try to run figlet again?

$ docker run -it ubuntu root@b13c164401fb:/\# figlet bash: figlet:
command not found

-   We started a *brand new container*.

-   The basic Ubuntu image was used, and figlet is not here.

-   We will see in the next chapters how to bake a custom image
    > with figlet.

<span id="page87" class="anchor"></span>

Lesson : Background Containers

> Objectives

Our first containers were *interactive*.

We will now see how to:

-   Run a non-interactive container.

-   Run a container in the background.

-   List running containers.

-   Check the logs of a container.

-   Stop a container.

-   List stopped containers.

<span id="page88" class="anchor"></span>

> A non-interactive container

We will run a small custom container.

This container just displays the time every second.

> $ docker run jpetazzo/clock Fri Feb 20 00:28:53 UTC Fri Feb 20
> 00:28:54 UTC Fri Feb 20 00:28:55 UTC
>
> ...

-   This container will run forever.

-   To stop it, press ^C.

-   Docker has automatically downloaded the image jpetazzo/clock.

-   This image is a user image, created by jpetazzo.

-   We will hear more about user images (and other types of images)
    > later.

<span id="page89" class="anchor"></span>

> Run a container in the background

Containers can be started in the background, with the -d flag (daemon
mode):

> $ docker run -d jpetazzo/clock
> 47d677dcfba4277c6cc68fcaa51f932b544cab1a187c853b7d0caf4e8debe5ad

-   We don't see the output of the container.

-   But don't worry: Docker collects that output and logs it!

-   Docker gives us the ID of the container.

<span id="page90" class="anchor"></span>

> List running containers

How can we check that our container is still running?

With docker ps, just like the UNIX ps command, lists running processes.

| $ docker ps  | IMAGE            | ... | CREATED         | STATUS           | ... |     |
|--------------|------------------|-----|-----------------|------------------|-----|-----|
| CONTAINER ID |                  |     |                 |                  |     |     |
| 47d677dcfba4 | jpetazzo/clock   | ... | 2 minutes ago   | Up 2 minutes ... |     |

Docker tells us:

-   The (truncated) ID of our container.

-   The image used to start the container.

-   That our container has been running (Up) for a couple of minutes.

-   Other information (COMMAND, PORTS, NAMES) that we will
    > explain later.

<span id="page91" class="anchor"></span>

> Starting more containers

Let's start two more containers.

> $ docker run -d jpetazzo/clock
> 57ad9bdfc06bb4407c47220cf59ce21585dce9a1298d7a67488359aeaea8ae2a $
> docker run -d jpetazzo/clock
> 068cc994ffd0190bbe025ba74e4c0771a5d8f14734af772ddee8dc1aaf20567d

Check that docker ps correctly reports all 3 containers.

<span id="page92" class="anchor"></span>

Two useful flags for docker ps

To see only the last container that was started:

| $ docker ps -l | IMAGE          | ... | CREATED         | STATUS           | ... |     |
|----------------|----------------|-----|-----------------|------------------|-----|-----|
| CONTAINER ID   |                |     |                 |                  |     |     |
| 068cc994ffd0   | jpetazzo/clock | ... | 2 minutes ago   | Up 2 minutes ... |     |

To see only the ID of containers:

> $ docker ps -q 068cc994ffd0 57ad9bdfc06b 47d677dcfba4

Combine those flags to see only the ID of the last container started!

> $ docker ps -lq 068cc994ffd0

<span id="page93" class="anchor"></span>

> View the logs of a container

We told you that Docker was logging the container output.

Let's see that now.

> $ docker logs 068
>
> Fri Feb 20 00:39:52 UTC Fri Feb 20 00:39:53 UTC
>
> ...

-   We specified a *prefix* of the full container ID.

-   You can, of course, specify the full ID.

-   The logs command will output the *entire* logs of the container.
    > (Sometimes, that will be too much. Let's see how to address that.)

<span id="page94" class="anchor"></span>

> View only the tail of the logs

To avoid being spammed with eleventy pages of output, we can use the
--tail option:

> $ docker logs --tail 3 068 Fri Feb 20 00:55:35 UTC Fri Feb 20 00:55:36
> UTC Fri Feb 20 00:55:37 UTC

-   The parameter is the number of lines that we want to see.

<span id="page95" class="anchor"></span>

> Follow the logs in real time

Just like with the standard UNIX command tail -f, we can follow the logs
of our container:

> $ docker logs --tail 1 --follow 068 Fri Feb 20 00:57:12 UTC
>
> Fri Feb 20 00:57:13 UTC ^C

-   This will display the last line in the log file.

-   Then, it will continue to display the logs in real time.

-   Use ^C to exit.

<span id="page96" class="anchor"></span>

> Stop our container

There are two ways we can terminate our detached container.

> • Killing it using the docker kill command.

-   Stopping it using the docker stop command.

The first one stops the container immediately, by using the KILL signal.

The second one is more graceful. It sends a TERM signal, and after 10
seconds, if the container has not stopped, it sends KILL.

Reminder: the KILL signal cannot be intercepted, and will forcibly
terminate the container.

<span id="page97" class="anchor"></span>

> Stopping our containers

Let's stop one of those containers:

> $ docker stop 47d6 47d6

This will take 10 seconds:

-   Docker sends the TERM signal;

-   the container doesn't react to this signal (it's a simple Shell
    > script with no special signal handling);

-   10 seconds later, since the container is still running, Docker sends
    > the KILL signal;

-   this terminates the container.

<span id="page98" class="anchor"></span>

> Killing the remaining containers

Let's be less patient with the two other containers:

> $ docker kill 068 57ad 068
>
> 57ad

The stop and kill commands can take multiple container IDs.

Those containers will be terminated immediately (without the 10 seconds
delay). Let's check that our containers don't show up anymore:

> $ docker ps

<span id="page99" class="anchor"></span>

> List stopped containers

We can also see stopped containers, with the -a (--all) option.

| $ docker ps -a | IMAGE          | ... | CREATED   | STATUS     |                          |               |            |
|----------------|----------------|-----|-----------|------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------|
| CONTAINER ID   |                |     |           |            |                          | min. ago      |            |
| 068cc994ffd0   | jpetazzo/clock | ... | 21        | min. ago   | Exited (137) 3           |               |            |
| 57ad9bdfc06b   | jpetazzo/clock | ... | 21        | min. ago   | Exited (137)             | 3             | min. ago   |
| 47d677dcfba4   | jpetazzo/clock | ... | 23        | min. ago   | Exited (137)             | 3             | min. ago   |
| 5c1dfd4d81f1   | jpetazzo/clock | ... | 40        | min. ago   | Exited (0) 40 min. ago   |               |
| b13c164401fb   | ubuntu         | ... | 55        | min. ago   | Exited (130)             | 53 min. ago   |            |

> Lesson: Restarting and Attaching to Containers
>
> Objectives

We have started containers in the foreground, and in the background. In
this chapter, we will see how to:

-   Put a container in the background.

-   Attach to a background container to bring it to the foreground.

-   Restart a stopped container.

<span id="page102" class="anchor"></span>

> Background and foreground

The distinction between foreground and background containers is
arbitrary. From Docker's point of view, all containers are the same.

All containers run the same way, whether there is a client attached to
them or not. It is always possible to detach from a container, and to
reattach to a container.

Analogy: attaching to a container is like plugging a keyboard and screen
to a physical server.

<span id="page103" class="anchor"></span>

> Detaching from a container

-   If you have started an *interactive* container (with option -it),
    > you can detach from it.

-   The "detach" sequence is ^P^Q.

-   Otherwise you can detach by killing the Docker client.

> (But not by hitting ^C, as this would deliver SIGINT to the
> container.)

What does -it stand for?

-   -t means "allocate a terminal."

-   -i means "connect stdin to the terminal."

Specifying a custom detach sequence

-   You don't like ^P^Q? No problem!

> • You can change the sequence with docker run --detach-keys.
>
> • This can also be passed as a global option to the engine.

Start a container with a custom detach command:

> $ docker run -ti --detach-keys ctrl-x,x jpetazzo/clock

Detach by hitting ^X x. (This is ctrl-x then x, not ctrl-x twice!)

Check that our container is still running:

> $ docker ps -l

<span id="page105" class="anchor"></span>

> Attaching to a container

You can attach to a container:

> $ docker attach &lt;containerID&gt;

-   The container must be running.

-   There *can* be multiple clients attached to the same container.

-   If you don't specify --detach-keys when attaching, it defaults back
    > to ^P^Q.

Try it on our previous container:

> $ docker attach $(docker ps -lq)

Check that ^X x doesn't work, but ^P ^Q does.

> Detaching from non-interactive containers

-   **Warning:** if the container was started without -it...

    -   You won't be able to detach with ^P^Q.

    -   If you hit ^C, the signal will be proxied to the container.

-   Remember: you can always detach by killing the Docker client.

<span id="page107" class="anchor"></span>

> Checking container output

• Use docker attach if you intend to send input to the container.

• If you just want to see the output of a container, use docker logs.

$ docker logs --tail 1 --follow &lt;containerID&gt;

> Restarting a container

When a container has exited, it is in stopped state.

It can then be restarted with the start command.

> $ docker start &lt;yourContainerID&gt;

The container will be restarted using the same options you launched it
with.

You can re-attach to it if you want to interact with it:

> $ docker attach &lt;yourContainerID&gt;

Use docker ps -a to identify the container ID of a previous
jpetazzo/clock container, and try those commands.

> Attaching to a REPL

-   REPL = Read Eval Print Loop

-   Shells, interpreters, TUI ...

-   Symptom: you docker attach, and see nothing

-   The REPL doesn't know that you just attached, and doesn't print
    anything

-   Try hitting ^L or Enter

> SIGWINCH

-   When you docker attach, the Docker Engine sends a couple of SIGWINCH
    signals to the container.

-   SIGWINCH = WINdow CHange; indicates a change in window size.

-   This will cause some CLI and TUI programs to redraw the screen.

-   But not all of them.

<span id="page112" class="anchor"></span>

Lesson: Understanding Docker Images

> Objectives

In this lesson, we will explain:

-   What is an image.

-   What is a layer.

-   The various image namespaces.

-   How to search and download images.

-   Image tags and when to use them.

> What is an image?

-   An image is a collection of files + some meta data.

> (Technically: those files form the root filesystem of a container.)

-   Images are made of *layers*, conceptually stacked on top of
    each other.

-   Each layer can add, change, and remove files.

-   Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times, and
    memory use.

-   Example:

    -   CentOS

    -   JRE

    -   Tomcat

    -   Dependencies

    -   Application JAR

    -   Configuration

> Differences between containers and images

-   An image is a read-only filesystem.

-   A container is an encapsulated set of processes running in a
    > read-write copy of that filesystem.

-   To optimize container boot time, *copy-on-write* is used instead of
    > regular copy.

-   docker run starts a container from a given image.

Let's give a couple of metaphors to illustrate those concepts.

> Image as stencils

Images are like templates or stencils that you can create containers
from.

<span id="page116" class="anchor"></span>

Object-oriented programming

-   Images are conceptually similar to *classes*.

-   Layers are conceptually similar to *inheritance*.

-   Containers are conceptually similar to *instances*.

> Wait a minute...

If an image is read-only, how do we change it?

-   We don't.

-   We create a new container from that image.

-   Then we make changes to that container.

-   When we are satisfied with those changes, we transform them into a
    > new layer.

-   A new image is created by stacking the new layer on top of the
    > old image.

> A chicken-and-egg problem

-   The only way to create an image is by "freezing" a container.

-   The only way to create a container is by instanciating an image.

-   Help!

Creating the first images

There is a special empty image called scratch.

-   It allows to *build from scratch*.

The docker import command loads a tarball into Docker.

-   The imported tarball becomes a standalone image.

-   That new image has a single layer.

Note: you will probably never have to do this yourself.

> Creating other images

docker commit

-   Saves all the changes made to a container into a new layer.

-   Creates a new image (effectively a copy of the container).

docker build

-   Performs a repeatable build sequence.

-   This is the preferred method!

We will explain both methods in a moment.

> Images namespaces

There are three namespaces:

-   Official images

> e.g. ubuntu, busybox ...

-   User (and organizations) images e.g. jpetazzo/clock

-   Self-hosted images

> e.g. registry.example.com:5000/my-private/image

Let's explain each of them.

> Root namespace

The root namespace is for official images. They are put there by ., but
they are generally authored and maintained by third parties.

Those images include:

-   Small, "swiss-army-knife" images like busybox.

-   Distro images to be used as bases for your builds, like
    > ubuntu, fedora...

-   Ready-to-use components and services, like redis, postgresql... User
    > namespace

The user namespace holds images for Docker Hub users and organizations.
For example:

> jpetazzo/clock

The Docker Hub user is:

> jpetazzo

The image name is:

> clock
>
> Self-Hosted namespace

This namespace holds images which are not hosted on Docker Hub, but on
third party registries.

They contain the hostname (or IP address), and optionally the port, of
the registry server.

For example:

> localhost:5000/wordpress

-   localhost:5000 is the host and port of the registry

-   wordpress is the name of the image

> How do you store and manage images?

Images can be stored:

-   On your Docker host.

-   In a Docker registry.

You can use the Docker client to download (pull) or upload (push)
images.

To be more accurate: you can use the Docker client to tell a Docker
server to push and pull images to and from a registry.

> Showing current images

Let's look at what images are on our host now.

| $ docker images | TAG      | IMAGE ID       | CREATED         | SIZE         |          |     |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|-----|

> Searching for images

We cannot list *all* images on a remote registry, but we can search for
a specific keyword:

| $ docker search zookeeper | STARS OFFICIAL              | AUTOMATED   |          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|----------|
| NAME                      | DESCRIPTION                 |             |          |
| jplock/zookeeper          | Builds a docker image ...   | 103         | \[OK\]   |
| mesoscloud/zookeeper      | ZooKeeper                   | 42          | \[OK\]   |

| elevy/zookeeper           | ZooKeeper configured t...   | 3           | \[OK\]   |

-   "Stars" indicate the popularity of the image.

-   "Official" images are those in the root namespace.

-   "Automated" images are built automatically by the Docker Hub.

> (This means that their build recipe is always available.)
>
> Downloading images

There are two ways to download images.

> • Explicitly, with docker pull.

-   Implicitly, when executing docker run and the image is not
    > found locally.

> Pulling an image

$ docker pull debian:jessie Pulling repository debian b164861940b8:
Download complete

b164861940b8: Pulling image (jessie) from debian d1881793a057: Download
complete

-   As seen previously, images are made up of layers.

-   Docker has downloaded all the necessary layers.

-   In this example, :jessie indicates which exact version of Debian we
    > would like. It is a *version tag*.

> Image and tags

-   Images can have tags.

-   Tags define image versions or variants.

> • docker pull ubuntu will refer to ubuntu:latest.

-   The :latest tag is generally updated often.

> When to (not) use tags

Don't specify tags:

-   When doing rapid testing and prototyping.

-   When experimenting.

-   When you want the latest version.

Do specify tags:

-   When recording a procedure into a script.

-   When going to production.

-   To ensure that the same version will be used everywhere.

-   To ensure repeatability later.

Section summary

We've learned how to:

-   Understand images and layers.

-   Understand Docker image namespacing.

-   Search and download images.

> Lesson: Building Images Interactively
>
> Objectives

In this lesson, we will create our first container image.

It will be a basic distribution image, but we will pre-install the
package figlet.

We will:

-   Create a container from a base image.

> Building Images Interactively

As we have seen, the images on the Docker Hub are sometimes very basic.
How do we want to construct our own images?

As an example, we will build an image that has figlet.

First, we will do it manually with docker commit.

Then, in an upcoming chapter, we will use a Dockerfile and docker build.

Building from a base

Our base will be the ubuntu image.

> Create a new container and make some changes

Start an Ubuntu container:

> $ docker run -it ubuntu root@&lt;yourContainerId&gt;:\#/

Run the command apt-get update to refresh the list of packages available
to install.

Then run the command apt-get install figlet to install the program we
are interested in.

> root@&lt;yourContainerId&gt;:\#/ apt-get update && apt-get install
> figlet
>
> .... OUTPUT OF APT-GET COMMANDS ....
>
> Inspect the changes

Type exit at the container prompt to leave the interactive session.

Now let's run docker diff to see the difference between the base image
and our container.

> $ docker diff &lt;yourContainerId&gt; C /root
>
> A /root/.bash\_history C /tmp
>
> C /usr
>
> C /usr/bin
>
> A /usr/bin/figlet
>
> ...
>
> Docker tracks filesystem changes

As explained before:

-   An image is read-only.

-   When we make changes, they happen in a copy of the image.

-   Docker can show the difference between the image, and its copy.

-   For performance, Docker uses copy-on-write systems.

> (i.e. starting a container based on a big image doesn't incur a huge
> copy.)
>
> Commit and run your image

The docker commit command will create a new layer with those changes,
and a new image using this new layer.

> $ docker commit &lt;yourContainerId&gt; &lt;newImageId&gt;

The output of the docker commit command will be the ID for your newly
created image.

We can run this image:

> $ docker run -it &lt;newImageId&gt; root@fcfb62f0bfde:/\# figlet hello

| \_      | \_ \_              |
|---------|--------------------|
| | |\_\_ | \_\_\_| | | \_\_\_ |

> | '\_ \\ / \_ \\ | |/ \_ \\
>
> | | | | \_\_/ | | (\_) | |\_| |\_|\\\_\_\_|\_|\_|\\\_\_\_/
>
> Tagging images

Referring to an image by its ID is not convenient. Let's tag it instead.
We can use the tag command:

> $ docker tag &lt;newImageId&gt; figlet

But we can also specify the tag as an extra argument to commit:

> $ docker commit &lt;containerId&gt; figlet

And then run it using its tag:

> $ docker run -it figlet
>
> What's next?

Manual process = bad.

Automated process = good.

In the next chapter, we will learn how to automate the build process by
writing a

Dockerfile.

> Lesson 9: Building Images With A Dockerfile
>
> Objectives

We will build a container image automatically, with a Dockerfile.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Write a Dockerfile.

-   Build an image from a Dockerfile.

> Dockerfile overview

-   A Dockerfile is a build recipe for a Docker image.

-   It contains a series of instructions telling Docker how an image
    is constructed.

-   The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile.

Writing our first Dockerfile

Our Dockerfile must be in a **new, empty directory**.

1.  Create a directory to hold our Dockerfile. $ mkdir myimage

2.  Create a Dockerfile inside this directory.

> $ cd myimage
>
> $ vim Dockerfile

Of course, you can use any other editor of your choice.

Type this into our Dockerfile...

FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install figlet

-   FROM indicates the base image for our build.

-   Each RUN line will be executed by Docker during the build.

-   Our RUN commands **must be non-interactive.**

> (No input can be provided to Docker during the build.)

-   In many cases, we will add the -y flag to apt-get.

> Build it!

Save our file, then execute:

> $ docker build -t figlet .

-   -t indicates the tag to apply to the image.

-   . indicates the location of the *build context*.

> (We will talk more about the build context later; but to keep things
> simple: this is the directory where our Dockerfile is located.)

What happens when we build the image?

The output of docker build looks like this:

> $ docker build -t figlet .
>
> Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB Sending build context
> to Docker daemon
>
> Step 0 : FROM ubuntu
>
> ---&gt; e54ca5efa2e9

>
> ---&gt; f9e8f1642759
>
> Removing intermediate container 2b44df762a2f Successfully built
> f9e8f1642759

-   The output of the RUN commands has been omitted.

-   Let's explain what this output means.

> Sending the build context to Docker

Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB

> • The build context is the . directory given to docker build.

-   It is sent (as an archive) by the Docker client to the
    > Docker daemon.

-   This allows to use a remote machine to build using local files.

-   Be careful (or patient) if that directory is big and your link
    > is slow.

> Executing each step

Step 1 : RUN apt-get update

---&gt; Running in 840cb3533193 (...output of the RUN command...)

> ---&gt; 7257c37726a1

Removing intermediate container 840cb3533193

-   A container (840cb3533193) is created from the base image.

-   The RUN command is executed in this container.

-   The container is committed into an image (7257c37726a1).

-   The build container (840cb3533193) is removed.

-   The output of this step will be the base image for the next one.

> The caching system

If you run the same build again, it will be instantaneous.

Why?

-   After each build step, Docker takes a snapshot of the
    > resulting image.

-   Before executing a step, Docker checks if it has already built the
    > same sequence.

-   Docker uses the exact strings defined in your Dockerfile, so:

    -   RUN apt-get install figlet cowsay is different from

> RUN apt-get install cowsay figlet

-   RUN apt-get update is not re-executed when the mirrors are updated

You can force a rebuild with docker build --no-cache ....

> Running the image

The resulting image is not different from the one produced manually.

> $ docker run -ti figlet root@91f3c974c9a1:/\# figlet hello

| \_      | \_ \_              |
|---------|--------------------|
| | |\_\_ | \_\_\_| | | \_\_\_ |

> | '\_ \\ / \_ \\ | |/ \_ \\
>
> | | | | \_\_/ | | (\_) | |\_| |\_|\\\_\_\_|\_|\_|\\\_\_\_/

-   Sweet is the taste of success!

> Using image and viewing history

The history command lists all the layers composing an image.

For each layer, it shows its creation time, size, and creation command.

When an image was built with a Dockerfile, each layer corresponds to a
line of the Dockerfile.

$ docker history figlet

| IMAGE           | CREATED             |

<span id="page155" class="anchor"></span>

Introducing JSON syntax

Most Dockerfile arguments can be passed in two forms:

-   plain string:

> RUN apt-get install figlet

-   JSON list:

> RUN \["apt-get", "install", "figlet"\]

Let's change our Dockerfile as follows!

> FROM ubuntu
>
> RUN apt-get update
>
> RUN \["apt-get", "install", "figlet"\]

Then build the new Dockerfile.

> $ docker build -t figlet .

JSON syntax vs string syntax

Compare the new history:

$ docker history figlet

| IMAGE           | CREATED             |

| /bin/sh -c \#(nop) ADD file:b    | 187.8   | MB   |     |

-   JSON syntax specifies an *exact* command to execute.

-   String syntax specifies a command to be wrapped within /bin/sh
    -c "...".

> Lesson: CMD and ENTRYPOINT
>
> Objectives

In this lesson, we will learn about two important Dockerfile commands:

CMD and ENTRYPOINT.

Those commands allow us to set the default command to run in a
container.

> Defining a default command

When people run our container, we want to greet them with a nice hello
message, and using a custom font.

For that, we will execute:

> figlet -f script hello

-   -f script tells figlet to use a fancy font.

-   hello is the message that we want it to display.

> Adding CMD to our Dockerfile

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

> FROM ubuntu
>
> RUN apt-get update
>
> RUN \["apt-get", "install", "figlet"\]
>
> CMD figlet -f script hello

-   CMD defines a default command to run when none is given.

-   It can appear at any point in the file.

-   Each CMD will replace and override the previous one.

-   As a result, while you can have multiple CMD lines, it is useless.

Build and test our image

Let's build it:

> $ docker build -t figlet .
>
> ...

| Successfully   | built 042dff3b4a8d            |      |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------|
| And run it:    |                               |      |
| $ docker run   | figlet                        |      |
| \_             |                               | \_   |
| | |            | \_                            | |    |
| | |            |                               | |    |
| |/ \\          | |/                            | |/   |
| |              | |\_/|\_\_/|\_\_/|\_\_/\\\_\_/ |      |

> Overriding CMD

If we want to get a shell into our container (instead of running
figlet), we just have to specify a different program to run:

> $ docker run -it figlet bash root@7ac86a641116:/\#

-   We specified bash.

-   It replaced the value of CMD.

> Using ENTRYPOINT

We want to be able to specify a different message on the command line,
while retaining figlet and some default parameters.

In other words, we would like to be able to do this:

> $ docker run figlet salut

|         |       | |    | \_  | |   |       |     |
|---------|-------|------|-----|-----|-------|-----|
| ,       | \_\_, |      |     |     | \_|\_ |     |
|         |       | |    |     | |   |       |     |
| / \\\_/ | |     | |/   | |   | | | |       |

> \\/ \\\_/|\_/|\_\_/ \\\_/|\_/|\_/

We will use the ENTRYPOINT verb in Dockerfile.

> Adding ENTRYPOINT to our Dockerfile

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

> FROM ubuntu
>
> RUN apt-get update
>
> RUN \["apt-get", "install", "figlet"\]
>
> ENTRYPOINT \["figlet", "-f", "script"\]

-   ENTRYPOINT defines a base command (and its parameters) for
    > the container.

-   The command line arguments are appended to those parameters.

-   Like CMD, ENTRYPOINT can appear anywhere, and replaces the
    > previous value.

Why did we use JSON syntax for our ENTRYPOINT?

> <span id="page165" class="anchor"></span>CMD and ENTRYPOINT
>
> Implications of JSON vs string syntax

-   When CMD or ENTRYPOINT use string syntax, they get wrapped in sh -c.

-   To avoid this wrapping, you must use JSON syntax.

What if we used ENTRYPOINT with string syntax?

> $ docker run figlet salut

This would run the following command in the figlet image:

> sh -c "figlet -f script" salut

Build and test our image

Let's build it:

> $ docker build -t figlet .
>
> ...
>
> Successfully built 36f588918d73

And run it:

> $ docker run figlet salut

|         |       | |    | \_  | |   |       |     |
|---------|-------|------|-----|-----|-------|-----|
| ,       | \_\_, |      |     |     | \_|\_ |     |
|         |       | |    |     | |   |       |     |
| / \\\_/ | |     | |/   | |   | | | |       |

> \\/ \\\_/|\_/|\_\_/ \\\_/|\_/|\_/

Great success!

Using CMD and ENTRYPOINT together

What if we want to define a default message for our container? Then we
will use ENTRYPOINT and CMD together.

-   ENTRYPOINT will define the base command for our container.

-   CMD will define the default parameter(s) for this command.

-   They *both* have to use JSON syntax.

> CMD and ENTRYPOINT together

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

> FROM ubuntu
>
> RUN apt-get update
>
> RUN \["apt-get", "install", "figlet"\]
>
> ENTRYPOINT \["figlet", "-f", "script"\]
>
> CMD \["hello world"\]

-   ENTRYPOINT defines a base command (and its parameters) for
    > the container.

-   If we don't specify extra command-line arguments when starting the
    > container, the value of CMD is appended.

-   Otherwise, our extra command-line arguments are used instead of CMD.

Build and test our image

Let's build it:

> $ docker build -t figlet .
>
> ...
>
> Successfully built 6e0b6a048a07

And run it:

| $ docker run | figlet  | \_                         |                    |     |     |

> Overriding ENTRYPOINT

What if we want to run a shell in our container?

We cannot just do docker run figlet bash because that would just tell
figlet to display the word "bash."

We use the --entrypoint parameter:

> $ docker run -it --entrypoint bash figlet root@6027e44e2955

<span id="page172" class="anchor"></span>

> Lesson: Copying files during the build
>
> Objectives

So far, we have installed things in our container images by downloading
packages. We can also copy files from the *build context* to the
container that we are building.

Remember: the *build context* is the directory containing the
Dockerfile. In this chapter, we will learn a new Dockerfile keyword:
COPY.

<span id="page173" class="anchor"></span>

> Build some C code

We want to build a container that compiles a basic "Hello world" program
in C. Here is the program, hello.c:

> int main () { puts("Hello, world!"); return 0;
>
> }

Let's create a new directory, and put this file in there.

Then we will write the Dockerfile.

> The Dockerfile

On Debian and Ubuntu, the package build-essential will get us a
compiler.

When installing it, don't forget to specify the -y flag, otherwise the
build will fail (since the build cannot be interactive).

Then we will use COPY to place the source file into the container.

> FROM ubuntu
>
> RUN apt-get update
>
> RUN apt-get install -y build-essential
>
> COPY hello.c /
>
> RUN make hello
>
> CMD /hello

Create this Dockerfile.

> Testing our C program

-   Create hello.c and Dockerfile in the same direcotry.

| •   | Run docker   | build -t hello . in this directory.        |
|-----|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| •   | Run docker   | run hello, you should see Hello, world!.   |

Success!

> COPY and the build cache

-   Run the build again.

-   Now, modify hello.c and run the build again.

-   Docker can cache steps involving COPY.

-   Those steps will not be executed again if the files haven't
    been changed.

> Details

-   You can COPY whole directories recursively.

-   Older Dockerfiles also have the ADD instruction. It is similar but
    can automatically extract archives.

-   If we really wanted to compile C code in a compiler, we would:

    -   Place it in a different directory, with the WORKDIR instruction.

    -   Even better, use the gcc official image.

> Lesson: Advanced Dockerfiles
>
> Objectives

We have seen simple Dockerfiles to illustrate how Docker build container
images. In this chapter, we will see:

-   The syntax and keywords that can be used in Dockerfiles.

-   Tips and tricks to write better Dockerfiles.

> Dockerfile usage summary

-   Dockerfile instructions are executed in order.

-   Each instruction creates a new layer in the image.

-   Instructions are cached. If no changes are detected then the
    instruction is skipped and the cached layer used.

-   The FROM instruction MUST be the first non-comment instruction.

-   Lines starting with \# are treated as comments.

-   You can only have one CMD and one ENTRYPOINT instruction in a

> Dockerfile.
>
> The FROM instruction

-   Specifies the source image to build this image.

-   Must be the first instruction in the Dockerfile, except
    for comments.

The FROM instruction

Can specify a base image:

> FROM ubuntu

An image tagged with a specific version:

> FROM ubuntu:12.04

A user image:

> FROM training/sinatra

Or self-hosted image:

> FROM localhost:5000/funtoo
>
> More about FROM

-   The FROM instruction can be specified more than once to build
    multiple images.

> FROM ubuntu:14.04
>
> . . .
>
> FROM fedora:20
>
> . . .
>
> Each FROM instruction marks the beginning of the build of a new image.
>
> The -t command-line parameter will only apply to the last image.

-   If the build fails, existing tags are left unchanged.

-   An optional version tag can be added after the name of the image.
    E.g.: ubuntu:14.04.

> A use case for multiple FROM lines

-   Integrate CI and unit tests in the build system

> FROM &lt;baseimage&gt;
>
> RUN &lt;install dependencies&gt;
>
> COPY &lt;code&gt;
>
> RUN &lt;build code&gt;
>
> RUN &lt;install test dependencies&gt;
>
> COPY &lt;test data sets and fixtures&gt;
>
> RUN &lt;unit tests&gt;
>
> FROM &lt;baseimage&gt;
>
> RUN &lt;install dependencies&gt;
>
> COPY &lt;vcode&gt;
>
> RUN &lt;build code&gt;
>
> CMD, EXPOSE ...

-   The build fails as soon as an instructions fails

-   If RUN &lt;unit tests&gt; fails, the build doesn't produce an image

<!-- -->

-   If it succeeds, it produces a clean image (without test libraries
    and data)

> The MAINTAINER instruction

The MAINTAINER instruction tells you who wrote the Dockerfile.

> MAINTAINER Docker Education Team &lt;education@docker.com&gt;

It's optional but recommended.

> The RUN instruction

The RUN instruction can be specified in two ways.

With shell wrapping, which runs the specified command inside a shell,
with /bin/sh -c:

> RUN apt-get update

Or using the exec method, which avoids shell string expansion, and
allows execution in images that don't have /bin/sh:

> RUN \[ "apt-get", "update" \]
>
> More about the RUN instruction

RUN will do the following:

-   Execute a command.

-   Record changes made to the filesystem.

-   Work great to install libraries, packages, and various files.

RUN will NOT do the following:

-   Record state of *processes*.

-   Automatically start daemons.

If you want to start something automatically when the container runs,
you should use

CMD and/or ENTRYPOINT.

> Collapsing layers

It is possible to execute multiple commands in a single step:

> RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && apt-get clean

It is also possible to break a command onto multiple lines: It is
possible to execute multiple commands in a single step:

> RUN apt-get update \\

-   apt-get install -y wget \\

-   apt-get clean

> The EXPOSE instruction

The EXPOSE instruction tells Docker what ports are to be published in
this image.

> EXPOSE 8080
>
> EXPOSE 80 443
>
> EXPOSE 53/tcp 53/udp

-   All ports are private by default.

-   The Dockerfile doesn't control if a port is publicly available.

-   When you docker run -p &lt;port&gt; ..., that port becomes public.

> (Even if it was not declared with EXPOSE.)

-   When you docker run -P ... (without port number), all ports declared
    > with EXPOSE become public.

A *public port* is reachable from other containers and from outside the
host.

A *private port* is not reachable from outside.

> The COPY instruction

The COPY instruction adds files and content from your host into the
image.

> COPY . /src

This will add the contents of the *build context* (the directory passed
as an argument to docker build) to the directory /src in the container.

Note: you can only reference files and directories *inside* the build
context. Absolute paths are taken as being anchored to the build
context, so the two following lines are equivalent:

> COPY . /src
>
> COPY / /src

Attempts to use .. to get out of the build context will be detected and
blocked with Docker, and the build will fail.

Otherwise, a Dockerfile could succeed on host A, but fail on host B.

> ADD

ADD works almost like COPY, but has a few extra features.

ADD can get remote files:

> ADD http://www.example.com/webapp.jar /opt/

This would download the webapp.jar file and place it in the /opt
directory.

ADD will automatically unpack zip files and tar archives:

> ADD ./assets.zip /var/www/htdocs/assets/

This would unpack assets.zip into /var/www/htdocs/assets.

*However,* ADD will not automatically unpack remote archives.

> ADD, COPY, and the build cache

-   For most Dockerfiles instructions, Docker only checks if the line in
    the Dockerfile has changed.

-   For ADD and COPY, Docker also checks if the files to be added to the
    container have been changed.

-   ADD always need to download the remote file before it can check if
    it has been changed. (It cannot use, e.g., ETags or
    If-Modified-Since headers.)

> VOLUME

The VOLUME instruction tells Docker that a specific directory should be
a *volume*.

> VOLUME /var/lib/mysql

Filesystem access in volumes bypasses the copy-on-write layer, offering
native performance to I/O done in those directories.

Volumes can be attached to multiple containers, allowing to "port" data
over from a container to another, e.g. to upgrade a database to a newer
version.

It is possible to start a container in "read-only" mode. The container
filesystem will be made read-only, but volumes can still have read/write
access if necessary

> The WORKDIR instruction

The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for subsequent
instructions.

It also affects CMD and ENTRYPOINT, since it sets the working directory
used when starting the container.

> WORKDIR /src

You can specify WORKDIR again to change the working directory for
further operations.

> The ENV instruction

The ENV instruction specifies environment variables that should be set
in any container launched from the image.

> ENV WEBAPP\_PORT 8080

This will result in an environment variable being created in any
containers created from this image of

> WEBAPP\_PORT=8080

You can also specify environment variables when you use docker run.

> $ docker run -e WEBAPP\_PORT=8000 -e WEBAPP\_HOST=www.example.com ...

The USER instruction

The USER instruction sets the user name or UID to use when running the
image.

It can be used multiple times to change back to root or to another user.

The CMD instruction

The CMD instruction is a default command run when a container is
launched from the image.

> CMD \[ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" \]

Means we don't need to specify nginx -g "daemon off;" when running the
container.

Instead of:

> $ docker run &lt;dockerhubUsername&gt;/web\_image nginx -g "daemon
> off;"

We can just do:

> $ docker run &lt;dockerhubUsername&gt;/web\_image

More about the CMD instruction

Just like RUN, the CMD instruction comes in two forms. The first
executes in a shell:

> CMD nginx -g "daemon off;"

The second executes directly, without shell processing:

> CMD \[ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" \]

Overriding the CMD instruction

The CMD can be overridden when you run a container.

> $ docker run -it &lt;dockerhubUsername&gt;/web\_image bash

Will run bash instead of nginx -g "daemon off;".

The ENTRYPOINT instruction

The ENTRYPOINT instruction is like the CMD instruction, but arguments
given on the command line are *appended* to the entry point.

Note: you have to use the "exec" syntax (\[ "..." \]).

> ENTRYPOINT \[ "/bin/ls" \]

If we were to run:

> $ docker run training/ls -l

Instead of trying to run -l, the container will run /bin/ls -l.

Overriding the ENTRYPOINT instruction

The entry point can be overriden as well.

| $    | docker   | run    | -it     | training/ls         | proc          | run    | srv   | tmp | var   |     |
|------|----------|--------|---------|---------------------|---------------|--------|-------|-----|-------|-----|
| bin  | dev      | home   | lib64   | mnt                 |               |        |       |     |       |     |
| boot | etc      | lib    | media   | opt                 | root          | sbin   | sys   | usr |       |     |
| $    | docker   | run    | -it     | --entrypoint bash   | training/ls   |        |       |     |

> How CMD and ENTRYPOINT interact

The CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions work best when used together.

> ENTRYPOINT \[ "nginx" \]
>
> CMD \[ "-g", "daemon off;" \]

The ENTRYPOINT specifies the command to be run and the CMD specifies its
options.

On the command line we can then potentially override the options when
needed.

> $ docker run -d &lt;dockerhubUsername&gt;/web\_image -t

This will override the options CMD provided with new flags.

> Advanced Dockerfile instructions

-   ONBUILD lets you stash instructions that will be executed when this
    image is used as a base for another one.

-   LABEL adds arbitrary metadata to the image.

-   ARG defines build-time variables (optional or mandatory).

> • STOPSIGNAL sets the signal for docker stop (TERM by default).

-   HEALTHCHECK defines a command assessing the status of the container.

-   SHELL sets the default program to use for string-syntax RUN,
    CMD, etc.

> The ONBUILD instruction

The ONBUILD instruction is a trigger. It sets instructions that will be
executed when another image is built from the image being build.

This is useful for building images which will be used as a base to build
other images.

> ONBUILD COPY . /src

-   You can't chain ONBUILD instructions with ONBUILD.

-   ONBUILD can't be used to trigger FROM and MAINTAINER instructions.

> Building an efficient Dockerfile

-   Each line in a Dockerfile creates a new layer.

-   Build your Dockerfile to take advantage of Docker's caching system.

-   Combine multiple similar commands into one by using && to continue
    commands and \\ to wrap lines.

-   COPY dependency lists (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) by
    themselves to avoid reinstalling unchanged dependencies every time.

> Example "bad" Dockerfile

The dependencies are reinstalled every time, because the build system
does not know if requirements.txt has been updated.

> FROM python
>
> MAINTAINER Docker Education Team &lt;education@docker.com&gt;
>
> COPY . /src/
>
> WORKDIR /src
>
> RUN pip install -qr requirements.txt
>
> EXPOSE 5000
>
> CMD \["python", "app.py"\]
>
> Fixed Dockerfile

Adding the dependencies as a separate step means that Docker can cache
more efficiently and only install them when requirements.txt changes.

> FROM python
>
> MAINTAINER Docker Education Team &lt;education@docker.com&gt;
>
> COPY ./requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
>
> RUN pip install -qr /tmp/requirements.txt
>
> COPY . /src/
>
> WORKDIR /src
>
> EXPOSE 5000
>
> CMD \["python", "app.py"\]
