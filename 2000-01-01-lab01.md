## Lab 1: Install Docker for your own Device

#### Objectives

At the end of this lab, you will have:

-   Installed Docker on your own device.

-   Run som commands to check if Docker is installed correctly.

--------

#### Step 1: Download Docker


First we must download Docker for your own Device, get the right packaged for your platform:

  - [Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise 64-bit](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi)
  - [Mac OS Yosemite 10.10.3 or above](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)

For previous versions get [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

--------

#### Step 2: Install Docker

Double-click on `Docker.dmg` for Mac and `InstallDocker.msi` for Windows to start the install process.

When the installation finishes, Docker starts automatically. On the Mac a whale in the top status bar for Mac or for Windows in the notification area indicates that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.

--------

#### Step 3: Run it

Open a command-line terminal --for Windows try PowerShell or install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)--, and try out some Docker commands.

- Run `docker version` to check that you have the latest release installed.

```
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:      17.03.1-ce
 API version:  1.27
 Go version:   go1.7.5
 Git commit:   c6d412e
 Built:        Tue Mar 28 00:40:02 2017
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

Server:
 Version:      17.03.1-ce
 API version:  1.27 (minimum version 1.12)
 Go version:   go1.7.5
 Git commit:   c6d412e
 Built:        Fri Mar 24 00:00:50 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 Experimental: true
```

- Run `docker run hello-world` to verify that Docker is pulling images and running as expected.

```
$ docker run hello-world
```

In the next lab, we will learn how to run our first application with Docker.
