## Lab 1: Install Docker for your own Device

--------

#### Step 1: Download Docker

--------

First we must download Docker for your own Device, get the right packaged [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) for Windows, Linux or Mac.

https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg

#### Step 2: Install Docker



Double-click on `Docker.dmg` for Mac and `InstallDocker.msi` for Windows to start the install process.

When the installation completes and Docker starts, the whale in the top status bar shows that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.


A Whale appears now in menu bar.

#### Step 3: Run it

**All platforms**

Open a command-line terminal - for Windows try PowerShell -, and try out some Docker commands.

- Run `docker version` to check that you have the latest release installed.

```
$ docker version
