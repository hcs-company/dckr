## Lab 8: CMD and ENTRYPOINT

--------

#### Objectives

In this lab, we will learn about two important Dockerfile commands: `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.

Those commands allow us to set the default command to run in a container.

--------

#### Step 1: Defining a default command

When people run our container, we want to greet them with a nice hello message, and using a custom font.

For that, we will execute: `figlet -f script hello`

-   `-f script` tells figlet to use a fancy font.

-   hello is the message that we want it to display.

We adding `CMD` to our Dockerfile. Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

```
 FROM ubuntu

 RUN apt-get update

 RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]

 CMD figlet -f script hello
```

-   `CMD` defines a default command to run when none is given.

-   It can appear at any point in the file.

-   Each `CMD` will replace and override the previous one.

-   As a result, while you can have multiple `CMD` lines, it is useless.

--------

#### Step 2: Build and test our image

Let's build it:

```
 $ docker build -t figlet .
 
 ...
 
 Successfully built 042dff3b4a8d
```

And run it: 

```
 $ docker run figlet 

 _          _   _
| |        | | | |
| |     _  | | | |  __
|/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_
|   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/

```

If we want to get a shell into our container (instead of running figlet), we just have to specify a different program to run:
```
 $ docker run -it figlet bash 
 root@7ac86a641116:/
```
-   We specified bash.

-   It replaced the value of `CMD`.

--------

#### Step 3: Using ENTRYPOINT

We want to be able to specify a different message on the command line, while retaining figlet and some default parameters.

In other words, we would like to be able to do this:
```
 $ docker run figlet salut
```

We will use the `ENTRYPOINT` verb in Dockerfile. Add` ENTRYPOINT` to your Dockerfile. Our new Dockerfile will look like this:
```
 FROM ubuntu

 RUN apt-get update

 RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]

 ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]
```
-   `ENTRYPOINT` defines a base command (and its parameters) for the container.

-   The command line arguments are appended to those parameters.

-   Like `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT` can appear anywhere, and replaces the previous value.


**Why did we use JSON syntax for our `ENTRYPOINT`?

-   When `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` use string syntax, they get wrapped in /bin/sh -c.

-   To avoid this wrapping, you must use JSON syntax.

**What if we used `ENTRYPOINT` with string syntax?

```
 $ docker run figlet salut
```

This would run the following command in the figlet image:
```
 sh -c "figlet -f script" salut
```
Build and test our image. Let's build it:
```
 $ docker build -t figlet .

 ...

 Successfully built 36f588918d73
```
And run it:
```
 $ docker run figlet salut
```

Great success!

--------

#### Step 4: Using CMD and ENTRYPOINT together

What if we want to define a default message for our container? Then we will use `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` together.

-   `ENTRYPOINT` will define the base command for our container.

-   `CMD` will define the default parameter(s) for this command.

-   They *both* have to use JSON syntax.

Our new Dockerfile will look like this:

```
 FROM ubuntu

 RUN apt-get update

 RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]

 ENTRYPOINT ["figlet", "-f", "script"]

 CMD ["hello world"]
```

-   `ENTRYPOINT` defines a base command (and its parameters) for the container.

-   If we don't specify extra command-line arguments when starting the container, the value of `CMD` is appended.

-   Otherwise, our extra command-line arguments are used instead of `CMD`.

--------

#### Step 5: Build and test our image

Let's build it:
```
 $ docker build -t figlet .

 ...

 Successfully built 6e0b6a048a07
```
And run it:

```
$ docker run figlet
```

```
 $ docker run figlet hola mundo
```

What if we want to run a shell in our container?

We cannot just do `docker run figlet bash` because that would just tell figlet to display the word "bash."

We use the --entrypoint parameter:
```
 $ docker run -it --entrypoint bash figlet 
 root@6027e44e2955
```
