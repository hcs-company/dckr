## Lab 7: Building Images With A Dockerfile

--------

#### Objectives

We will build a container image automatically, with a Dockerfile.

At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

-   Write a Dockerfile.

-   Build an image from a Dockerfile.

#### Dockerfile overview

-   A Dockerfile is a build recipe for a Docker image.

-   It contains a series of instructions telling Docker how an image is constructed.

-   The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile.

--------

#### Step 1: Writing our first Dockerfile

Our Dockerfile must be in a **new, empty directory**.

Create a directory to hold our Dockerfile. 
```
$ mkdir myimage
```
Create a Dockerfile inside this directory.
```
 $ cd myimage
 $ vi Dockerfile
```
Of course, you can use any other editor of your choice, if you are using a Windows device.

Type this into our Dockerfile:
```
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install figlet
```

-   FROM indicates the base image for our build.

-   Each RUN line will be executed by Docker during the build.

-   Our RUN commands **must be non-interactive.**
    (No input can be provided to Docker during the build.)

-   In many cases, we will add the `-y` flag to apt-get.

--------

#### Step 2: Build our image

Save our file, then execute:
```
 $ docker build -t figlet:v1 .
```
-  `-t` indicates the tag to apply to the image.

-   `.` indicates the location of the *build context*.
(We will talk more about the build context later; but to keep things simple: this is the directory where our Dockerfile is located.)

-   `:v1` tag it with a version number.

What happens when we build the image? The output of docker build looks like this:

```
 $ docker build -t figlet:v1 .
 Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB 
 Step 1/3 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> e54ca5efa2e9
 Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Running in 840cb3533193
 
 ...
 
 ---> 7257c37726a1
 Removing intermediate container 840cb3533193 
 Step 3/3 : RUN apt-get install figlet
 ---> Running in 2b44df762a2f
 
 ...
 
 ---> f9e8f1642759
 Removing intermediate container 2b44df762a2f 
 Successfully built f9e8f1642759
 Successfully tagged figlet:v1
```

The output of the RUN commands has been omitted. Let's explain what this output means:

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
```
-   The build context is the `.` directory given to `docker build`.

-   It is sent (as an archive) by the Docker client to the Docker daemon.

-   This allows to use a remote machine to build using local files.

-   Be careful (or patient) if that directory is big and your link is slow.

The next step is:

```
Step 2/3 : RUN apt-get update

---> Running in 840cb3533193

(...output of the RUN command...)

 ---> 7257c37726a1

Removing intermediate container 840cb3533193
```

-   A container (840cb3533193) is created from the base image.

-   The RUN command is executed in this container.

-   The container is committed into an image (7257c37726a1).

-   The build container (840cb3533193) is removed.

-   The output of this step will be the base image for the next one.

Step 3 is like step 2.

**The caching system**

If you run the same build again, it will be instantaneous. Why?

-   After each build step, Docker takes a snapshot of the resulting image.

-   Before executing a step, Docker checks if it has already built the same sequence.

-   Docker uses the exact strings defined in your Dockerfile, so:

    * `RUN apt-get install figlet cowsay` is different from `RUN apt-get install cowsay figlet`

    * `RUN apt-get update` is not re-executed when the mirrors are updated.

You can force a rebuild with `docker build --no-cache`.

--------

#### Step 3: Running the image and viewing history

The resulting image is not different from the one produced manually.

```
 $ docker run -ti figlet:v1
 root@91f3c974c9a1:/# figlet hello
     _          _ _
    | |__   ___| | | ___
    |  _ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \
    | | | |  __/ | | (_) |
    |_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/
```

The `history` command lists all the layers composing an image.

For each layer, it shows its creation time, size, and creation command.

When an image was built with a Dockerfile, each layer corresponds to a line of the Dockerfile.
```
$ docker history figlet:v1

IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE         COMMENT
694e4c34b249        13 minutes ago      /bin/sh -c apt-get install figlet               1.45MB
9f66bb25c374        13 minutes ago      /bin/sh -c apt-get update                       38.2MB
f7b3f317ec73        13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["/bin/bash"]            0B
<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c mkdir -p /run/systemd && echo '...   7B

```

#### Step 4: Introducing JSON syntax

Most Dockerfile arguments can be passed in two forms:

-   plain string: `RUN apt-get install figlet`

-   JSON list: `RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]`

Let's change our Dockerfile as follows:

```
 FROM ubuntu

 RUN apt-get update

 RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
```

Then build the new Dockerfile.

```
 $ docker build -t figlet:v2 .
```

Compare the new history:
```
$ docker history figlet:v2
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT
aa4000a75080        About an hour ago   apt-get install figlet                          1.02 MB
240990a28931        About an hour ago   /bin/sh -c apt-get update                       38.3 MB
ebcd9d4fca80        6 days ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["/bin/bash"]            0 B
<missing>           6 days ago          /bin/sh -c mkdir -p /run/systemd && echo '...   7 B
<missing>           6 days ago          /bin/sh -c sed -i 's/^#\s*\(deb.*universe\...   2.76 kB
<missing>           6 days ago          /bin/sh -c rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*          0 B
<missing>           6 days ago          /bin/sh -c set -xe   && echo '#!/bin/sh' >...   745 B
<missing>           6 days ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:d14b493577228a4...   118 MB
```
-   JSON syntax specifies an *exact* command to execute.

-   String syntax specifies a command to be wrapped within `/bin/sh -c "..."`.
